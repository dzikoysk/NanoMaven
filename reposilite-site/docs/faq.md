**Q:** Maven randomly interrupts deploy and throws socket write error <br>
**A:** It is a common issue on Java 12 due to the bug related to SSL. To resolve this problem, just change Java version used by Maven build, e.g. 8 or 14. 

**Q:** Checksum validation failed on the maven-metadata.xml <br>
**A:** Checksum validation always fails, because Reposilite does not trust the metadata files offered by client - they're generated by server, based on the repository content to ensure consistency. 
It's fine and it does not affect your builds.

**Q:** Repository content is not updated when I use CDN *(like Cloudflare)*<br>
**A:** It is a problem with CDN cache, because Reposilite does not store any files in memory to reduce usage of resources. 
You should take a look at cache policy of your provider. 
For instance, if you use Cloudflare, you can set `Cache Level` to `Bypass` through the custom page rules.

**Q:** Artifacts fail to deploy and I see ``Body already consumed, and was too big to cache. Adjust cache size with `config.requestCacheSize = newMaxSize;` `` in the log <br>
**A:** If you have `debugEnabled`, this can happen with very large artifacts. You can try to tune this by setting the system property `reposilite.requestCacheSize` (defaults to 8MB) to the maximum artifact size. e.g.
`-Dreposilite.requestCacheSize=20MB`. See using [system properties](./configuration#system-properties) for more information on setting this.
